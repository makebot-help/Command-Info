# m.play

#### Description

Searches YouTube for your search query and returns 10 results for you to choose from for it to play in VC. Disconnecting makebot while it's in vc may break m.play and every other music command, causing them to be unusable until makebot is restarted. Currently there is no way to restore functionality to the music commands before said restart happens.

#### Example

> m.play raccoon eating grapes
