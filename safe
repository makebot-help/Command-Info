Searches safebooru for the tags you provided.

----------------------------------------------
Experiencing a problem with this command?

m.safe (tags you want to search) searches Safebooru for the tags you suggested. It's an embed that returns only the tag(s) you searched for in the author name and a random picture it pulled from the results of what it searched. Spaces are treated as seperate tags, so if what you're looking for has a space in it (ex. Kanna Kamui), make sure to replace the space with an underscore (ex. Kanna_Kamui). If you misspell a tag or try to search for a tag that doesn't exist, it'll suspend the command and not return a response.
