# SFW Command Changes

#### Description

To activate the SFW commands, type out the NSFW variant in a SFW channel so it searches the SFW alternative. (ex. m.e621 in a SFW channel will search e926 instead.) Not every NSFW command has a SFW alternative, so the commands that do not have those must be used exclusively in an NSFW channel.
