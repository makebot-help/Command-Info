# m.paheal

#### Description

Searches tags of your choice on rule34.paheal.net and returns a random result. This command uses a node API different than the one used for the m.r34 command, so proper error handling hasn't been implemented yet. No results in the last 10 seconds means there's no results for the tags you've searched.

#### SFW Alternative
If you use m.e621 in a SFW channel, it will search e926 instead and return a random result from there.

#### Example

> m.e621 furry
