# m.sub

#### Description

Searches the subreddit of your choice and returns a random picture taken from said subreddit. This command currently can't return text posts, only pictures. However, that will be added in the near future.

#### SFW Alternative
There is no SFW alternative that can be activated by using the command in a SFW channel. m.sub must be used exclusively in an NSFW channel.
